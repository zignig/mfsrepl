update the mfs lib
 - create directories
 - copy into place
 - backup into a dated folder

repl needs to
 - check where the info is coming from
 - actually sync the folders onto the local mfs

later on 
 - give each node a key ( not the ipfs key )
 - republish to ipns
 - use ipfs key discovery to find nodes that are sharing
 - work out how to diff merkel dags so folders can be converged
 - talk to whyrusleeping to get /mfs/ exposed on the ipfs gateway.

more stuff ...
