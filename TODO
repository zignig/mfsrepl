keystuff
 - rationalize key stuff
 - only send some of the keys each gossip run
 - set up onion routing to obfuscate the origin of keys
 - keys
   - web of trust
   - key expiry
 - dump keysets to ipfs (maybe)
update the mfs lib
 - create directories
 - copy into place
 - backup into a dated folder

repl needs to
 - check where the info is coming from
 - actually sync the folders onto the local mfs
 - use sha sum to determine change

later on 
 - republish to ipns
 - use ipfs key discovery to find nodes that are sharing
 - work out how to diff merkel dags so folders can be converged
 - talk to whyrusleeping to get /mfs/ exposed on the ipfs gateway.

more stuff ...
