# IPFS MFS replicator

This program uses weaveworks mesh to share the local mfs hashes to other ipfs nodes

At present it only collects the hashes and does not actually copy them across.

The repository is in GB format so you will need https://github.com/constabulary/gb to compile it correctly. 

# Instructions 

1. gb build
2. run ./bin/repl 
3. this will create a default config file
4. edit the peers and password and run again
5. the has of /share in mfs will be collected and distributed to all nodes.

# TODO

see TODO file.

At present this is just a proof of concept, need security and checking.
